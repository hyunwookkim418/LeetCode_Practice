# 1
select project_id, round(avg(experience_years), 2) as average_years
from Project p
left join Employee e
on p.employee_id = e.employee_id
group by project_id

# My explanation
This problem requires us to find the average years of experience for all employees assigned to each project.
As output, we need to provide project_id and average_years accordingly. 
The Project table contains the project_id column, and the Employee table contains the experience_years column. 
We can combine these two tables using a join operation 
and calculate the average experience_years using a group by project_id condition.
