# My explanation
This question requires us to sort dates by their IDs with higher temperatures compared to their previous dates.
To compare dates within the same rows, I intend to use a join operation applying the condition DATEDIFF(w2.recordDate, w1.recordDate) = 1. 
In my initial attempt, I made a mistake by using w2.recordDate - w1.recordDate = 1. 
This condition only considers days, not months and years. 
However, the DATEDIFF() function considers the full date, including years and months.
After creating a combined table, we can directly compare w2.temperature to w1.temperature. 
If w2.temperature is greater than w1.temperature, it indicates a rising temperature.
