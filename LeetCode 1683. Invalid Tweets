#1 faster
select tweet_id 
from Tweets
where length(content) > 15

#2 also works
select tweet_id
from Tweets
where char_length(content) > 15

# My explanation
This problem requires us to filter out invalid tweets from the table named "Tweets." 
Tweets are considered invalid if their length is strictly greater than 15 characters. 
To filter these invalid tweets, we can use the char_length() function 
and apply a condition like WHERE char_length(content) > 15.
