select u.unique_id, e.name

left join EmployeeUNI u
on e.id = u.id

select unique_id, a.name 
from EmployeeUNI b
right join Employees a
on a.id=b.id;

# My explanation
To display the unique_id for each user, and assign a null value if a user does not have a unique_id, 
we need to combine data from the Employees and EmployeeUNI tables. 
The output table should have unique_id and name columns, 
but the Employees table has the name column, while the EmployeeUNI table contains the unique_id.

To achieve this, we can use a JOIN operation. 
Specifically, we can use a LEFT JOIN to combine these two tables based on the Employees table. 
This requires a common column for the JOIN condition, which in this case is the id column present in both tables.

The LEFT JOIN keyword allows us to include all records from the Employees table (the left table)
and the matching records from the EmployeeUNI table (the right table). 
If there is no match, the result will show null for the columns from the EmployeeUNI table.
