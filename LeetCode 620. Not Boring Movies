select id, movie, description, rating
from Cinema
where id % 2 = 1 and description <> "boring"
order by rating desc

# My explanation
We need to filter out the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring." 
After that, we need to sort the results in descending order based on rating. 
We can achieve this by using the condition WHERE id % 2 = 1 AND description <> "boring". 
After that, we can employ the ORDER BY keyword to sort the results in descending order.
