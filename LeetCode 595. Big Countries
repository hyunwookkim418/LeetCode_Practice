# My explanation
This problem requires us to find the names of countries that have an area of at least three million square kilometers 
and a population of at least twenty-five million people. As the problem asks us to select the name, population, 
and area in that order, we need to make the selections accordingly. 
After that, we can apply conditions such as area >= 3,000,000 and population >= 25,000,000.
