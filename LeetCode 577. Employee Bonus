# My Explanation
To find the names of employees who receive a bonus of less than 1000, 
we need to use a join operation to combine the Employee table and the Bonus table. 
These two tables can be joined on the common column empID. 
By using a LEFT JOIN operation, we attach the Bonus table to the Employee table, 
ensuring that all employees are included even if they do not have a corresponding bonus entry.

After performing the join, we can apply a condition to filter employees 
whose bonus is less than 1000 or is null. 
The SQL code for this operation is simple and 
includes a WHERE clause to filter based on the bonus amount.
