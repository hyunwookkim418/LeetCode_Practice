select activity_date as day, count(distinct user_id) as active_users
from Activity
where activity_date between '2019-06-28' and '2019-07-27'
group by activity_date

# between '2019-06-28' and '2019-07-27' NOT between 2019-06-28 and 2019-07-27

# My explanation
To find the daily active user count for the 30-day period ending on 2019-07-27 
(inclusive of 2019-06-28 and 2019-07-27), we should group the data by activity_date 
and then count the user_id or session_id without duplicates. 
To ensure no duplicates are counted, we can use the DISTINCT keyword. 
Additionally, when writing dates in SQL, we should enclose them in single quotation marks.
