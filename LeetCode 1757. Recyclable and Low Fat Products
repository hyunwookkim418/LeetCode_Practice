# My explanation:
This question asks us to select low-fat and recyclable product IDs. 
To do that, we need to use the "low_fats" and "recyclable" columns. 
If both columns contain "Y," it means the product is low-fat and recyclable. 
Therefore, we need to select from the "Products" table and then select product IDs 
using the condition that both "low_fats" and "recyclable" are "Y." 
First, we can write: SELECT product_id FROM Products 
Then, we can add the condition: WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'
This will give us product IDs 1 and 3.
