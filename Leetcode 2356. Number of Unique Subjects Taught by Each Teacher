select teacher_id, count(distinct subject_id) as cnt
from Teacher
group by teacher_id

# My explanation
This problem requires determining the number of unique subjects taught by each teacher. 
To achieve this, we need to count the number of unique subjects 
using the COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) function. 
The DISTINCT keyword ensures that only unique values are counted. 
Then, we need to group the results based on teacher_id.
