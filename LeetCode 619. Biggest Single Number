# My explanation
This problem requires us to find the largest single number.
To achieve the desired output, we need to satisfy two conditions:
1. The largest value
2. A single (non-repeating) number

There is no way to satisfy these two different conditions with one single query.
To apply two different conditions, I would like to use a subquery to limit the range.
For example, if we first select only single numbers by using a subquery, 
we can then choose the maximum value with the MAX function. 
The syntax of a subquery can be somewhat complicated when you use it for the first time. 
To limit the selection to only single numbers, we can write a condition like:
WHERE num IN (SELECT num FROM MyNumbers GROUP BY num HAVING COUNT(num) = 1)
