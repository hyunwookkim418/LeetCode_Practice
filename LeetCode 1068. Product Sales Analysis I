#1
select p.product_name, s.year, s.price
from Sales AS s
inner join Product as p
on s.product_id = p.product_id;

#2
select product_name, year, price
from Sales 
left join  Product using (product_id);

#3 
select p.product_name, s.year, s.price
from Sales as s
left join Product as p
on s.product_id = p.product_id;

# My explanation
This problem requires returning data from the Sales table along with the product_name. 
Since the Sales table doesn't contain product_name, we need to utilize the Product table, 
which includes the product_id column. We can accomplish this by employing a Join operation 
to combine the two separate tables. For a Join operation to work, 
the tables must share a common column, which in this case is product_id. 
Using a Left Join will merge the Product table with the Sales table, 
attaching the Product table to the left side and retaining records from the Sales table, 
if there are matching values. This approach enables us to obtain the desired output.
