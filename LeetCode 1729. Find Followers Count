select user_id, count(follower_id) as followers_count
from Followers
group by user_id
order by user_id asc

# My explanation
The problem requires us to return the number of followers for each user. 
In the Followers table, the first column represents user_id, 
and the second column represents follower_id. 
For example, in the first row, 0 in the user_id column means that user 0 is followed by follower 1, 
represented by 1 in the follower_id column. 
To count the number of followers for each user, we can use the count() function with the distinct keyword 
to select the unique number of followers. Finally, we can sort the results in ascending order using order by user_id.
